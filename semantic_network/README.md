# Semantic network

A semantic network will be concepts stored within a graph-based data structure and accessible via an app with an API to interface. Each semantic network will be atomic for a specific subject, for example, a Python coding semantic network or a semantic network based on your email inbox. A Python coding semantic network may be read-only and publicly accessible while your email inbox semantic network would be read/write and private. The concepts and relationships will be added to the semantic network via an orchestrator.
