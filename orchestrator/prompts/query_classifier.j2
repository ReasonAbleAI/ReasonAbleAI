Your job is to classify how releveant all of the given topics are to the prompt below. Do not deviate from the instructions or make things up.

Here are the topics and their desciptions as a JSON Blob:

{"topics": [{% for compentency in compentencies %}
  {"topic name": "{{ compentency.name }}", "topic description": "{{ compentency.description }}"}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{%- endfor %}
]}

For each topic name, you will return a relevance score between 0 and 1 representing how relevant the prompt is to the given topic.

You should return a JSON Blob object with the structure:

{ "ratios": [{"topic name": <topic_name>, "relevance": <relevance_score>}] }

Example response:

{ "ratios": [{% for compentency in compentencies %}{"topic name": "{{ compentency.name }}", "relevance": 0.{{ loop.index }}}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %}]}

Return ONLY the JSON Blob object, nothing else.

{{ prompt }}
